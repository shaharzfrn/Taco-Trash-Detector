    "* start as simple as possible. dealing with APIs are not the easiest for the first time and i predict that this would be your main issue. only when you have a running model that learn, you can add learning tricks.\n",
    "* use the visualization of a notebook, as we did over the course, check that your input actually fitting the model, the output is the desired size and so on.\n",
    "* It is recommanded to change the images to a fixed size, like shown in here :https://github.com/pedropro/TACO/blob/master/detector/inspect_data.ipynb\n",
    "* Please adress the architecture and your loss function/s in this notebook. if you decided to add some loss component like the Focal loss for instance, try to show the results before and after using it.\n",
