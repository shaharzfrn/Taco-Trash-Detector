After learning that self-attention is gaining popularity thanks to the shiny new transformer models, you decide to change the model from the tutorial: instead of the queries being equal to the decoder hidden states, you use self-attention, so that the keys, queries and values are all equal to the encoder's hidden states (with learned projections). What influence do you expect this will have on the learned hidden states?\n"
